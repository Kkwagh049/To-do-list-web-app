To-Do List Application
Description:

This application provides a user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and tracking to-do tasks. It leverages Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface, Matplotlib for data visualization, and PIL for image handling.
Features:

Task Creation: Users can easily add new tasks to the list, specifying their description, due date, and priority.
Task Management: Tasks can be marked as completed, edited, or deleted.
Task Prioritization: Tasks can be categorized into different priority levels (e.g., high, medium, low) for better organization.
Visualization: Matplotlib is used to generate charts or graphs that provide an overview of task completion rates, priority distributions, or other relevant metrics.
Customizable Appearance: Users may be able to personalize the application's appearance by selecting different themes or color schemes.
